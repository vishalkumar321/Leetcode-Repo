# 1614. Maximum Nesting Depth of the Parentheses

## Problem Statement

Given a valid parentheses string s, return the nesting depth of s. The nesting depth is the maximum number of nested parentheses.

Example 1:

Input: s = "(1+(2*3)+((8)/4))+1"

Output: 3

Explanation:

Digit 8 is inside of 3 nested parentheses in the string.

Example 2:

Input: s = "(1)+((2))+(((3)))"

Output: 3

Explanation:

Digit 3 is inside of 3 nested parentheses in the string.

Example 3:

Input: s = "()(())((()()))"

Output: 3

Constraints:

	1 <= s.length <= 100
	s consists of digits 0-9 and characters &#39;+&#39;, &#39;-&#39;, &#39;*&#39;, &#39;/&#39;, &#39;(&#39;, and &#39;)&#39;.
	It is guaranteed that parentheses expression s is a VPS.
