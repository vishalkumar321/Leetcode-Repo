# 796. Rotate String

## Problem Statement

Given two strings s and goal, return true if and only if s can become goal after some number of shifts on s.

A shift on s consists of moving the leftmost character of s to the rightmost position.

	For example, if s = "abcde", then it will be "bcdea" after one shift.

Example 1:
Input: s = "abcde", goal = "cdeab"
Output: true
Example 2:
Input: s = "abcde", goal = "abced"
Output: false

Constraints:

	1 <= s.length, goal.length <= 100
	s and goal consist of lowercase English letters.

## Solution

The solution is implemented in C++ and can be found in the `solution.cpp` file.
