# 17. Letter Combinations of a Phone Number

## Problem Statement

Given a string containing digits from 2-9 inclusive, return all possible letter combinations that the number could represent. Return the answer in any order.

A mapping of digits to letters (just like on the telephone buttons) is given below. Note that 1 does not map to any letters.

Example 1:

Input: digits = "23"
Output: ["ad","ae","af","bd","be","bf","cd","ce","cf"]

Example 2:

Input: digits = ""
Output: []

Example 3:

Input: digits = "2"
Output: ["a","b","c"]

Constraints:

	0 <= digits.length <= 4
	digits[i] is a digit in the range [&#39;2&#39;, &#39;9&#39;].

## Solution

The solution is implemented in C++ and can be found in the `solution.cpp` file.
