# 104. Maximum Depth of Binary Tree

## Problem Statement

Given the root of a binary tree, return its maximum depth.

A binary tree&#39;s maximum depth is the number of nodes along the longest path from the root node down to the farthest leaf node.

Example 1:

Input: root = [3,9,20,null,null,15,7]
Output: 3

Example 2:

Input: root = [1,null,2]
Output: 2

Constraints:

	The number of nodes in the tree is in the range [0, 104].
	-100 <= Node.val <= 100

## Solution

The solution is implemented in C++ and can be found in the `solution.cpp` file.
