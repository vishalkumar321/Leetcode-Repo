# 199. Binary Tree Right Side View

## Problem Statement

Given the root of a binary tree, imagine yourself standing on the right side of it, return the values of the nodes you can see ordered from top to bottom.

Example 1:

Input: root = [1,2,3,null,5,null,4]

Output: [1,3,4]

Explanation:

Example 2:

Input: root = [1,2,3,4,null,null,null,5]

Output: [1,3,4,5]

Explanation:

Example 3:

Input: root = [1,null,3]

Output: [1,3]

Example 4:

Input: root = []

Output: []

Constraints:
