# 1248. Count Number of Nice Subarrays

## Problem Statement

Given an array of integers nums and an integer k. A continuous subarray is called nice if there are k odd numbers on it.

Return the number of nice sub-arrays.

Example 1:

Input: nums = [1,1,2,1,1], k = 3
Output: 2
Explanation: The only sub-arrays with 3 odd numbers are [1,1,2,1] and [1,2,1,1].

Example 2:

Input: nums = [2,4,6], k = 1
Output: 0
Explanation: There are no odd numbers in the array.

Example 3:

Input: nums = [2,2,2,1,2,2,1,2,2,2], k = 2
Output: 16

Constraints:

	1 <= nums.length <= 50000
	1 <= nums[i] <= 10^5
	1 <= k <= nums.length

## Solution

The solution is implemented in C++ and can be found in the `solution.cpp` file.
