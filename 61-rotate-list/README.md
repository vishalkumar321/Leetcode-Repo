# 61. Rotate List

## Problem Statement

Given the head of a linked list, rotate the list to the right by k places.

Example 1:

Input: head = [1,2,3,4,5], k = 2
Output: [4,5,1,2,3]

Example 2:

Input: head = [0,1,2], k = 4
Output: [2,0,1]

Constraints:

	The number of nodes in the list is in the range [0, 500].
	-100 <= Node.val <= 100
	0 <= k <= 2 * 109

## Solution

The solution is implemented in C++ and can be found in the `solution.cpp` file.
