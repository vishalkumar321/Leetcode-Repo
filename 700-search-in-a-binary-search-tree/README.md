# 700. Search in a Binary Search Tree

## Problem Statement

You are given the root of a binary search tree (BST) and an integer val.

Find the node in the BST that the node&#39;s value equals val and return the subtree rooted with that node. If such a node does not exist, return null.

Example 1:

Input: root = [4,2,7,1,3], val = 2
Output: [2,1,3]

Example 2:

Input: root = [4,2,7,1,3], val = 5
Output: []

Constraints:

	The number of nodes in the tree is in the range [1, 5000].
	1 <= Node.val <= 107
	root is a binary search tree.
	1 <= val <= 107

## Solution

The solution is implemented in C++ and can be found in the `solution.cpp` file.
