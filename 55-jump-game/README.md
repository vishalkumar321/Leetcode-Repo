# 55. Jump Game

## Problem Statement

You are given an integer array nums. You are initially positioned at the array&#39;s first index, and each element in the array represents your maximum jump length at that position.

Return true if you can reach the last index, or false otherwise.

Example 1:

Input: nums = [2,3,1,1,4]
Output: true
Explanation: Jump 1 step from index 0 to 1, then 3 steps to the last index.

Example 2:

Input: nums = [3,2,1,0,4]
Output: false
Explanation: You will always arrive at index 3 no matter what. Its maximum jump length is 0, which makes it impossible to reach the last index.

Constraints:

	1 <= nums.length <= 104
	0 <= nums[i] <= 105

## Solution

The solution is implemented in C++ and can be found in the `solution.cpp` file.
