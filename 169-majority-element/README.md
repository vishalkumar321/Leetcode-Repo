# 169. Majority Element

## Problem Statement

Given an array nums of size n, return the majority element.

The majority element is the element that appears more than &lfloor;n / 2&rfloor; times. You may assume that the majority element always exists in the array.

Example 1:
Input: nums = [3,2,3]
Output: 3
Example 2:
Input: nums = [2,2,1,1,1,2,2]
Output: 2

Constraints:

	n == nums.length
	1 <= n <= 5 * 104
	-109 <= nums[i] <= 109

Follow-up: Could you solve the problem in linear time and in O(1) space?

## Solution

The solution is implemented in C++ and can be found in the `solution.cpp` file.
