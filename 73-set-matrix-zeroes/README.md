# 73. Set Matrix Zeroes

## Problem Statement

Given an m x n integer matrix matrix, if an element is 0, set its entire row and column to 0&#39;s.

You must do it in place.

Example 1:

Input: matrix = [[1,1,1],[1,0,1],[1,1,1]]
Output: [[1,0,1],[0,0,0],[1,0,1]]

Example 2:

Input: matrix = [[0,1,2,0],[3,4,5,2],[1,3,1,5]]
Output: [[0,0,0,0],[0,4,5,0],[0,3,1,0]]

Constraints:

	m == matrix.length
	n == matrix[0].length
	1 <= m, n <= 200
	-231 <= matrix[i][j] <= 231 - 1

Follow up:

	A straightforward solution using O(mn) space is probably a bad idea.
	A simple improvement uses O(m + n) space, but still not the best solution.
	Could you devise a constant space solution?

## Solution

The solution is implemented in C++ and can be found in the `solution.cpp` file.
