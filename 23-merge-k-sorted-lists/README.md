# 23. Merge k Sorted Lists

## Problem Statement

You are given an array of k linked-lists lists, each linked-list is sorted in ascending order.

Merge all the linked-lists into one sorted linked-list and return it.

Example 1:

Input: lists = [[1,4,5],[1,3,4],[2,6]]
Output: [1,1,2,3,4,4,5,6]
Explanation: The linked-lists are:
[
  1->4->5,
  1->3->4,
  2->6
]
merging them into one sorted linked list:
1->1->2->3->4->4->5->6

Example 2:

Input: lists = []
Output: []

Example 3:

Input: lists = [[]]
Output: []

Constraints:

	k == lists.length
	0 <= k <= 104
	0 <= lists[i].length <= 500
	-104 <= lists[i][j] <= 104
	lists[i] is sorted in ascending order.
	The sum of lists[i].length will not exceed 104.

## Solution

The solution is implemented in C++ and can be found in the `solution.cpp` file.
