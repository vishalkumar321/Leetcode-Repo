# 215. Kth Largest Element in an Array

## Problem Statement

Given an integer array nums and an integer k, return the kth largest element in the array.

Note that it is the kth largest element in the sorted order, not the kth distinct element.

Can you solve it without sorting?

Example 1:
Input: nums = [3,2,1,5,6,4], k = 2
Output: 5
Example 2:
Input: nums = [3,2,3,1,2,4,5,5,6], k = 4
Output: 4

Constraints:

	1 <= k <= nums.length <= 105
	-104 <= nums[i] <= 104

## Solution

The solution is implemented in C++ and can be found in the `solution.cpp` file.
