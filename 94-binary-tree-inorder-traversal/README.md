# 94. Binary Tree Inorder Traversal

## Problem Statement

Given the root of a binary tree, return the inorder traversal of its nodes&#39; values.

Example 1:

Input: root = [1,null,2,3]

Output: [1,3,2]

Explanation:

Example 2:

Input: root = [1,2,3,4,5,null,8,null,null,6,7,9]

Output: [4,2,6,5,7,1,3,9,8]

Explanation:

Example 3:

Input: root = []

Output: []

Example 4:

Input: root = [1]

Output: [1]

Constraints:

	The number of nodes in the tree is in the range [0, 100].
	-100 <= Node.val <= 100

Follow up: Recursive solution is trivial, could you do it iteratively?

## Solution

The solution is implemented in C++ and can be found in the `solution.cpp` file.
