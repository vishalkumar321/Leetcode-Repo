# 28. Find the Index of the First Occurrence in a String

## Problem Statement

Given two strings needle and haystack, return the index of the first occurrence of needle in haystack, or -1 if needle is not part of haystack.

Example 1:

Input: haystack = "sadbutsad", needle = "sad"
Output: 0
Explanation: "sad" occurs at index 0 and 6.
The first occurrence is at index 0, so we return 0.

Example 2:

Input: haystack = "leetcode", needle = "leeto"
Output: -1
Explanation: "leeto" did not occur in "leetcode", so we return -1.

Constraints:

	1 <= haystack.length, needle.length <= 104
	haystack and needle consist of only lowercase English characters.

## Solution

The solution is implemented in C++ and can be found in the `solution.cpp` file.
