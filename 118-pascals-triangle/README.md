# 118. Pascal's Triangle

## Problem Statement

Given an integer numRows, return the first numRows of Pascal&#39;s triangle.

In Pascal&#39;s triangle, each number is the sum of the two numbers directly above it as shown:

Example 1:
Input: numRows = 5
Output: [[1],[1,1],[1,2,1],[1,3,3,1],[1,4,6,4,1]]
Example 2:
Input: numRows = 1
Output: [[1]]

Constraints:

	1 <= numRows <= 30

## Solution

The solution is implemented in C++ and can be found in the `solution.cpp` file.
