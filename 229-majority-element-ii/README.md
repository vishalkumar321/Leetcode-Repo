# 229. Majority Element II

## Problem Statement

Given an integer array of size n, find all elements that appear more than &lfloor; n/3 &rfloor; times.

Example 1:

Input: nums = [3,2,3]
Output: [3]

Example 2:

Input: nums = [1]
Output: [1]

Example 3:

Input: nums = [1,2]
Output: [1,2]

Constraints:

	1 <= nums.length <= 5 * 104
	-109 <= nums[i] <= 109
