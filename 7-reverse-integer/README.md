# 7. Reverse Integer

## Problem Statement

Given a signed 32-bit integer x, return x with its digits reversed. If reversing x causes the value to go outside the signed 32-bit integer range [-231, 231 - 1], then return 0.

Assume the environment does not allow you to store 64-bit integers (signed or unsigned).

Example 1:

Input: x = 123
Output: 321

Example 2:

Input: x = -123
Output: -321

Example 3:

Input: x = 120
Output: 21

Constraints:

	-231 <= x <= 231 - 1

## Solution

The solution is implemented in C++ and can be found in the `solution.cpp` file.
