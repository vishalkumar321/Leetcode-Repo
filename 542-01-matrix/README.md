# 542. 01 Matrix

## Problem Statement

Given an m x n binary matrix mat, return the distance of the nearest 0 for each cell.

The distance between two cells sharing a common edge is 1.

Example 1:

Input: mat = [[0,0,0],[0,1,0],[0,0,0]]
Output: [[0,0,0],[0,1,0],[0,0,0]]

Example 2:

Input: mat = [[0,0,0],[0,1,0],[1,1,1]]
Output: [[0,0,0],[0,1,0],[1,2,1]]

Constraints:

	m == mat.length
	n == mat[i].length
	1 <= m, n <= 104
	1 <= m * n <= 104
	mat[i][j] is either 0 or 1.
	There is at least one 0 in mat.
