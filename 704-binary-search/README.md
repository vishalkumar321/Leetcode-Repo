# 704. Binary Search

## Problem Statement

Given an array of integers nums which is sorted in ascending order, and an integer target, write a function to search target in nums. If target exists, then return its index. Otherwise, return -1.

You must write an algorithm with O(log n) runtime complexity.

Example 1:

Input: nums = [-1,0,3,5,9,12], target = 9
Output: 4
Explanation: 9 exists in nums and its index is 4

Example 2:

Input: nums = [-1,0,3,5,9,12], target = 2
Output: -1
Explanation: 2 does not exist in nums so return -1

Constraints:

	1 <= nums.length <= 104
	-104 < nums[i], target < 104
	All the integers in nums are unique.
	nums is sorted in ascending order.

## Solution

The solution is implemented in C++ and can be found in the `solution.cpp` file.
