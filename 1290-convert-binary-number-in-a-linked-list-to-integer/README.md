# 1290. Convert Binary Number in a Linked List to Integer

## Problem Statement

Given head which is a reference node to a singly-linked list. The value of each node in the linked list is either 0 or 1. The linked list holds the binary representation of a number.

Return the decimal value of the number in the linked list.

The most significant bit is at the head of the linked list.

Example 1:

Input: head = [1,0,1]
Output: 5
Explanation: (101) in base 2 = (5) in base 10

Example 2:

Input: head = [0]
Output: 0

Constraints:

	The Linked List is not empty.
	Number of nodes will not exceed 30.
	Each node&#39;s value is either 0 or 1.

## Solution

The solution is implemented in C++ and can be found in the `solution.cpp` file.
