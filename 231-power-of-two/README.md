# 231. Power of Two

## Problem Statement

Given an integer n, return true if it is a power of two. Otherwise, return false.

An integer n is a power of two, if there exists an integer x such that n == 2x.

Example 1:

Input: n = 1
Output: true
Explanation: 20 = 1

Example 2:

Input: n = 16
Output: true
Explanation: 24 = 16

Example 3:

Input: n = 3
Output: false

Constraints:

	-231 <= n <= 231 - 1

Follow up: Could you solve it without loops/recursion?

## Solution

The solution is implemented in C++ and can be found in the `solution.cpp` file.
