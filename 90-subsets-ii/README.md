# 90. Subsets II

## Problem Statement

Given an integer array nums that may contain duplicates, return all possible subsets (the power set).

The solution set must not contain duplicate subsets. Return the solution in any order.

Example 1:
Input: nums = [1,2,2]
Output: [[],[1],[1,2],[1,2,2],[2],[2,2]]
Example 2:
Input: nums = [0]
Output: [[],[0]]

Constraints:

	1 <= nums.length <= 10
	-10 <= nums[i] <= 10

## Solution

The solution is implemented in C++ and can be found in the `solution.cpp` file.
