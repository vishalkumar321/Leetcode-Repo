# 85. Maximal Rectangle

## Problem Statement

Given a rows x cols binary matrix filled with 0&#39;s and 1&#39;s, find the largest rectangle containing only 1&#39;s and return its area.

Example 1:

Input: matrix = [["1","0","1","0","0"],["1","0","1","1","1"],["1","1","1","1","1"],["1","0","0","1","0"]]
Output: 6
Explanation: The maximal rectangle is shown in the above picture.

Example 2:

Input: matrix = [["0"]]
Output: 0

Example 3:

Input: matrix = [["1"]]
Output: 1

Constraints:

	rows == matrix.length
	cols == matrix[i].length
	1 <= row, cols <= 200
	matrix[i][j] is &#39;0&#39; or &#39;1&#39;.
