# 103. Binary Tree Zigzag Level Order Traversal

## Problem Statement

Given the root of a binary tree, return the zigzag level order traversal of its nodes&#39; values. (i.e., from left to right, then right to left for the next level and alternate between).

Example 1:

Input: root = [3,9,20,null,null,15,7]
Output: [[3],[20,9],[15,7]]

Example 2:

Input: root = [1]
Output: [[1]]

Example 3:

Input: root = []
Output: []

Constraints:

	The number of nodes in the tree is in the range [0, 2000].
	-100 <= Node.val <= 100

## Solution

The solution is implemented in C++ and can be found in the `solution.cpp` file.
