# 3099. Harshad Number

## Problem Statement

An integer divisible by the sum of its digits is said to be a Harshad number. You are given an integer x. Return the sum of the digits of x if x is a Harshad number, otherwise, return -1.

Example 1:

Input: x = 18

Output: 9

Explanation:

The sum of digits of x is 9. 18 is divisible by 9. So 18 is a Harshad number and the answer is 9.

Example 2:

Input: x = 23

Output: -1

Explanation:

The sum of digits of x is 5. 23 is not divisible by 5. So 23 is not a Harshad number and the answer is -1.

Constraints:

	1 <= x <= 100

## Solution

The solution is implemented in C++ and can be found in the `solution.cpp` file.
