# 98. Validate Binary Search Tree

## Problem Statement

Given the root of a binary tree, determine if it is a valid binary search tree (BST).

A valid BST is defined as follows:

	The left subtree of a node contains only nodes with keys strictly less than the node&#39;s key.
	The right subtree of a node contains only nodes with keys strictly greater than the node&#39;s key.
	Both the left and right subtrees must also be binary search trees.

Example 1:

Input: root = [2,1,3]
Output: true

Example 2:

Input: root = [5,1,4,null,null,3,6]
Output: false
Explanation: The root node&#39;s value is 5 but its right child&#39;s value is 4.

Constraints:

	The number of nodes in the tree is in the range [1, 104].
	-231 <= Node.val <= 231 - 1

## Solution

The solution is implemented in C++ and can be found in the `solution.cpp` file.
