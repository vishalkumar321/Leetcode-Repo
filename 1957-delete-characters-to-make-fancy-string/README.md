# 1957. Delete Characters to Make Fancy String

## Problem Statement

A fancy string is a string where no three consecutive characters are equal.

Given a string s, delete the minimum possible number of characters from s to make it fancy.

Return the final string after the deletion. It can be shown that the answer will always be unique.

Example 1:

Input: s = "leeetcode"
Output: "leetcode"
Explanation:
Remove an &#39;e&#39; from the first group of &#39;e&#39;s to create "leetcode".
No three consecutive characters are equal, so return "leetcode".

Example 2:

Input: s = "aaabaaaa"
Output: "aabaa"
Explanation:
Remove an &#39;a&#39; from the first group of &#39;a&#39;s to create "aabaaaa".
Remove two &#39;a&#39;s from the second group of &#39;a&#39;s to create "aabaa".
No three consecutive characters are equal, so return "aabaa".

Example 3:

Input: s = "aab"
Output: "aab"
Explanation: No three consecutive characters are equal, so return "aab".

Constraints:

	1 <= s.length <= 105
	s consists only of lowercase English letters.
