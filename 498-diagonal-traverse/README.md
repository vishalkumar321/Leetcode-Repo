# 498. Diagonal Traverse

## Problem Statement

Given an m x n matrix mat, return an array of all the elements of the array in a diagonal order.

Example 1:

Input: mat = [[1,2,3],[4,5,6],[7,8,9]]
Output: [1,2,4,7,5,3,6,8,9]

Example 2:

Input: mat = [[1,2],[3,4]]
Output: [1,2,3,4]

Constraints:

	m == mat.length
	n == mat[i].length
	1 <= m, n <= 104
	1 <= m * n <= 104
	-105 <= mat[i][j] <= 105

## Solution

The solution is implemented in C++ and can be found in the `solution.cpp` file.
