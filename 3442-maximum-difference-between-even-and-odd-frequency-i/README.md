# 3442. Maximum Difference Between Even and Odd Frequency I

## Problem Statement

You are given a string s consisting of lowercase English letters.

Your task is to find the maximum difference diff = freq(a1) - freq(a2) between the frequency of characters a1 and a2 in the string such that:

	a1 has an odd frequency in the string.
	a2 has an even frequency in the string.

Return this maximum difference.

Example 1:

Input: s = "aaaaabbc"

Output: 3

Explanation:

	The character &#39;a&#39; has an odd frequency of 5, and &#39;b&#39; has an even frequency of 2.
	The maximum difference is 5 - 2 = 3.

Example 2:

Input: s = "abcabcab"

Output: 1

Explanation:

	The character &#39;a&#39; has an odd frequency of 3, and &#39;c&#39; has an even frequency of 2.
	The maximum difference is 3 - 2 = 1.

Constraints:

	3 <= s.length <= 100
	s consists only of lowercase English letters.
	s contains at least one character with an odd frequency and one with an even frequency.
