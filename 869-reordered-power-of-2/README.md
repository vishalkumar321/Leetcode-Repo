# 869. Reordered Power of 2

## Problem Statement

You are given an integer n. We reorder the digits in any order (including the original order) such that the leading digit is not zero.

Return true if and only if we can do this so that the resulting number is a power of two.

Example 1:

Input: n = 1
Output: true

Example 2:

Input: n = 10
Output: false

Constraints:

	1 <= n <= 109

## Solution

The solution is implemented in C++ and can be found in the `solution.cpp` file.
