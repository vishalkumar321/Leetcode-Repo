# 283. Move Zeroes

## Problem Statement

Given an integer array nums, move all 0&#39;s to the end of it while maintaining the relative order of the non-zero elements.

Note that you must do this in-place without making a copy of the array.

Example 1:
Input: nums = [0,1,0,3,12]
Output: [1,3,12,0,0]
Example 2:
Input: nums = [0]
Output: [0]

Constraints:

	1 <= nums.length <= 104
	-231 <= nums[i] <= 231 - 1

Follow up: Could you minimize the total number of operations done?

## Solution

The solution is implemented in C++ and can be found in the `solution.cpp` file.
