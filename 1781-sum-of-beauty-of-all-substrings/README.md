# 1781. Sum of Beauty of All Substrings

## Problem Statement

The beauty of a string is the difference in frequencies between the most frequent and least frequent characters.

	For example, the beauty of "abaacc" is 3 - 1 = 2.

Given a string s, return the sum of beauty of all of its substrings.

Example 1:

Input: s = "aabcb"
Output: 5
Explanation: The substrings with non-zero beauty are ["aab","aabc","aabcb","abcb","bcb"], each with beauty equal to 1.

Example 2:

Input: s = "aabcbaa"
Output: 17

Constraints:

	1 <= s.length <= 500
	s consists of only lowercase English letters.

## Solution

The solution is implemented in C++ and can be found in the `solution.cpp` file.
