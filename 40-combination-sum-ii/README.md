# 40. Combination Sum II

## Problem Statement

Given a collection of candidate numbers (candidates) and a target number (target), find all unique combinations in candidates where the candidate numbers sum to target.

Each number in candidates may only be used once in the combination.

Note: The solution set must not contain duplicate combinations.

Example 1:

Input: candidates = [10,1,2,7,6,1,5], target = 8
Output: 
[
[1,1,6],
[1,2,5],
[1,7],
[2,6]
]

Example 2:

Input: candidates = [2,5,2,1,2], target = 5
Output: 
[
[1,2,2],
[5]
]

Constraints:

	1 <= candidates.length <= 100
	1 <= candidates[i] <= 50
	1 <= target <= 30

## Solution

The solution is implemented in C++ and can be found in the `solution.cpp` file.
