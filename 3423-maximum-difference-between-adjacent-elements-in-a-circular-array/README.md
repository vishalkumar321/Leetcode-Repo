# 3423. Maximum Difference Between Adjacent Elements in a Circular Array

## Problem Statement

Given a circular array nums, find the maximum absolute difference between adjacent elements.

Note: In a circular array, the first and last elements are adjacent.

Example 1:

Input: nums = [1,2,4]

Output: 3

Explanation:

Because nums is circular, nums[0] and nums[2] are adjacent. They have the maximum absolute difference of |4 - 1| = 3.

Example 2:

Input: nums = [-5,-10,-5]

Output: 5

Explanation:

The adjacent elements nums[0] and nums[1] have the maximum absolute difference of |-5 - (-10)| = 5.

Constraints:

	2 <= nums.length <= 100
	-100 <= nums[i] <= 100

## Solution

The solution is implemented in C++ and can be found in the `solution.cpp` file.
