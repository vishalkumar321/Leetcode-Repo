# 424. Longest Repeating Character Replacement

## Problem Statement

You are given a string s and an integer k. You can choose any character of the string and change it to any other uppercase English character. You can perform this operation at most k times.

Return the length of the longest substring containing the same letter you can get after performing the above operations.

Example 1:

Input: s = "ABAB", k = 2
Output: 4
Explanation: Replace the two &#39;A&#39;s with two &#39;B&#39;s or vice versa.

Example 2:

Input: s = "AABABBA", k = 1
Output: 4
Explanation: Replace the one &#39;A&#39; in the middle with &#39;B&#39; and form "AABBBBA".
The substring "BBBB" has the longest repeating letters, which is 4.
There may exists other ways to achieve this answer too.

Constraints:

	1 <= s.length <= 105
	s consists of only uppercase English letters.
	0 <= k <= s.length

## Solution

The solution is implemented in C++ and can be found in the `solution.cpp` file.
