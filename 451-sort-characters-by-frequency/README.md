# 451. Sort Characters By Frequency

## Problem Statement

Given a string s, sort it in decreasing order based on the frequency of the characters. The frequency of a character is the number of times it appears in the string.

Return the sorted string. If there are multiple answers, return any of them.

Example 1:

Input: s = "tree"
Output: "eert"
Explanation: &#39;e&#39; appears twice while &#39;r&#39; and &#39;t&#39; both appear once.
So &#39;e&#39; must appear before both &#39;r&#39; and &#39;t&#39;. Therefore "eetr" is also a valid answer.

Example 2:

Input: s = "cccaaa"
Output: "aaaccc"
Explanation: Both &#39;c&#39; and &#39;a&#39; appear three times, so both "cccaaa" and "aaaccc" are valid answers.
Note that "cacaca" is incorrect, as the same characters must be together.

Example 3:

Input: s = "Aabb"
Output: "bbAa"
Explanation: "bbaA" is also a valid answer, but "Aabb" is incorrect.
Note that &#39;A&#39; and &#39;a&#39; are treated as two different characters.

Constraints:

	1 <= s.length <= 5 * 105
	s consists of uppercase and lowercase English letters and digits.
