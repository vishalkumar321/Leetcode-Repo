# 234. Palindrome Linked List

## Problem Statement

Given the head of a singly linked list, return true if it is a palindrome or false otherwise.

Example 1:

Input: head = [1,2,2,1]
Output: true

Example 2:

Input: head = [1,2]
Output: false

Constraints:

	The number of nodes in the list is in the range [1, 105].
	0 <= Node.val <= 9

Follow up: Could you do it in O(n) time and O(1) space?

## Solution

The solution is implemented in C++ and can be found in the `solution.cpp` file.
