# 347. Top K Frequent Elements

## Problem Statement

Given an integer array nums and an integer k, return the k most frequent elements. You may return the answer in any order.

Example 1:

Input: nums = [1,1,1,2,2,3], k = 2

Output: [1,2]

Example 2:

Input: nums = [1], k = 1

Output: [1]

Example 3:

Input: nums = [1,2,1,2,1,2,3,1,3,2], k = 2

Output: [1,2]

Constraints:

	1 <= nums.length <= 105
	-104 <= nums[i] <= 104
	k is in the range [1, the number of unique elements in the array].
	It is guaranteed that the answer is unique.

Follow up: Your algorithm&#39;s time complexity must be better than O(n log n), where n is the array&#39;s size.

## Solution

The solution is implemented in C++ and can be found in the `solution.cpp` file.
