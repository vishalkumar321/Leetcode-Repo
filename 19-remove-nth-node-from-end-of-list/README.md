# 19. Remove Nth Node From End of List

## Problem Statement

Given the head of a linked list, remove the nth node from the end of the list and return its head.

Example 1:

Input: head = [1,2,3,4,5], n = 2
Output: [1,2,3,5]

Example 2:

Input: head = [1], n = 1
Output: []

Example 3:

Input: head = [1,2], n = 1
Output: [1]

Constraints:

	The number of nodes in the list is sz.
	1 <= sz <= 30
	0 <= Node.val <= 100
	1 <= n <= sz

Follow up: Could you do this in one pass?

## Solution
