# 1004. Max Consecutive Ones III

## Problem Statement

Given a binary array nums and an integer k, return the maximum number of consecutive 1&#39;s in the array if you can flip at most k 0&#39;s.

Example 1:

Input: nums = [1,1,1,0,0,0,1,1,1,1,0], k = 2
Output: 6
Explanation: [1,1,1,0,0,1,1,1,1,1,1]
Bolded numbers were flipped from 0 to 1. The longest subarray is underlined.

Example 2:

Input: nums = [0,0,1,1,0,0,1,1,1,0,1,1,0,0,0,1,1,1,1], k = 3
Output: 10
Explanation: [0,0,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,0,0,0,1,1,1,1]
Bolded numbers were flipped from 0 to 1. The longest subarray is underlined.

Constraints:

	1 <= nums.length <= 105
	nums[i] is either 0 or 1.
	0 <= k <= nums.length

## Solution

The solution is implemented in C++ and can be found in the `solution.cpp` file.
